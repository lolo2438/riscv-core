STEP 0: Define goal
Develop a Risc-V cpu core. The core will be conform to the priviledged and unpriviledge riscv spec.
Easily extensible
Implement with intuition, optimize with research.

STEP 1: Define architecture
The risc-v core will be RV64G -> IMADZifencei
D implies F
F implies Zicsr

The core will be SYNCHRONOUS

STEP 2: Define modules
Fetch
decode & register
ALU
WriteBack

STEP 3: Build functional model
Single cycle core

STEP 4: Upgrade model
Select: Superscalar, pipeline, multi-core, threads.
